# 🔁 Module 04: Loops and Iteration

This module explores looping in Python using `for` and `while` loops. You'll also learn about 
`range()`, iterable objects like lists and dictionaries, and the `with` construct (context managers) for reading files and other structured repetition.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

* Use `for` loops with `range()` and iterables
* Control loop repetition using `while` and boolean conditions
* Use `break` and `continue` to manage loop flow
* Read files using `with open(...) as f:` and iterate over lines
