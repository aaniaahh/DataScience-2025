# üìö Glossary: 05 - Foundations

**Cell:**
A block in a Jupyter notebook that can contain code or Markdown. Code cells run Python, Markdown cells render formatted text.

**Command Mode:**
Notebook mode (blue border) where you can operate on cells (add, delete, move). Enter with `Esc`.

**Edit Mode:**
Notebook mode (green border) where you type inside a cell. Enter with `Enter`.

**DataFrame:**
A 2D table of data provided by Pandas. Has rows, columns, and labels.

**Docstring:**
The built-in documentation attached to a Python object, viewable with `?`, `??`, or `help()`.

**Export:**
Saving a notebook as another format (`.py`, `.html`, `.pdf`). Done via File ‚Üí Download as‚Ä¶ or `%save`.

**File Path:**
The location of a file in your system (`/content/data/file.csv` in Colab, C:\Users\me\data.csv on Windows).

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**
A structured file format using key‚Äìvalue pairs. Often used for configs and web APIs.

**Kernel:**
The ‚Äúengine‚Äù that runs code inside Jupyter. For Python, this is IPython.

**LaTeX:**
A math typesetting language. Used in notebooks for equations like $ E = mc^2 $.

**List Comprehension:**
A compact way to build lists in Python: `[x**2 for x in range(10)]`.

**Magic Command:**
Special IPython commands starting with `%` or `%%` that provide shortcuts (e.g., `%time`, `%pwd`).

**Markdown:**
A lightweight markup language for text formatting in notebooks: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `# heading`.

**NumPy:**
A Python library for fast array operations. Supports vectorized math like `arr ** 2`.

**Performance:**
How efficiently code runs. Measured with `%time`, `%timeit`. NumPy is usually faster than loops.

**Tab Completion:**
Pressing `Tab` after a dot (`obj.`) in Jupyter to see available methods and attributes.

**Variable Explorer:**
Commands like `%who` and `%whos` that list variables currently in memory.

**Vectorization:**
Applying operations to an entire array at once (NumPy/Pandas) instead of looping.

**Virtual Environment (venv):**
A self-contained Python environment with its own installed packages. Not part of Foundations, but used locally for clean setups.
