# üìö Glossary ‚Äì Describing and Visualizing Data

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Data
* **Quantitative Data**: Numeric values that can be measured (e.g., height, income).
* **Qualitative (Categorical) Data**: Non-numeric categories or labels (e.g., color, gender).
Discrete Data: Countable values (e.g., number of students).
Continuous Data: Measurable values within a range (e.g., weight, time).
Nominal Data: Categories without order (e.g., eye color).
Ordinal Data: Ordered categories (e.g., small, medium, large).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Summary Statistics
Mean: The arithmetic average of a dataset.
Median: The middle value when data are ordered.
Mode: The most frequent value in a dataset.
Range: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
Variance: Measure of data spread around the mean.
Standard Deviation (œÉ): Average distance from the mean.
Quartiles & IQR: Divide data into quarters; IQR = Q3 ‚Äì Q1.
Outlier: A value significantly higher or lower than most of the data.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Matplotlib Basics
Matplotlib: A core Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots.
Figure: The overall window or page that everything is drawn on.
Axes: The area where data is plotted (contains x/y labels, ticks, etc.).
plot(): Draws line plots of data.
bar(): Creates a bar chart.
hist(): Displays a histogram of numeric data.
scatter(): Creates a scatter plot for relationships between two variables.
xlabel(), ylabel(): Label axes for clarity.
title(): Adds a chart title.
legend(): Displays label identifiers for plotted data.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Seaborn Basics
Seaborn: A Python visualization library built on Matplotlib for attractive statistical graphics.
sns.barplot(): Displays mean values with confidence intervals.
sns.histplot(): Shows data distribution with flexible bin control.
sns.scatterplot(): Creates scatter plots with style and hue options.
sns.boxplot(): Shows data distribution through quartiles and outliers.
sns.violinplot(): Combines boxplot and density visualization.
sns.heatmap(): Visualizes correlations or matrices with color gradients.
Style & Theme: Seaborn allows quick aesthetic control (e.g., sns.set_style('whitegrid')).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization Mini-Lab
Trend: General direction of data movement in a chart.
Outlier: A point that differs greatly from other observations.
Correlation: Statistical relationship between two variables (positive, negative, or none).
Distribution: The pattern of frequency of data points.
Visualization Best Practice: Always label axes, include units, and provide readable titles.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Process of visually exploring datasets to summarize main characteristics.
