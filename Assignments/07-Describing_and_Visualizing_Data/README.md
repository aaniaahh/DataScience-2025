# 🧼 Module 07 - Describing and Visualizing Data

## 📖 Overview
This week we move beyond raw numbers and start making sense of data through **description** and **visualization**.
You’ll learn how to classify different types of data, compute meaningful summary statistics, and create visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

The week culminates in a mini-lab, where you’ll explore trends and outliers in a real dataset.
By the end, you should feel comfortable turning numbers into insights (and plots that don’t look like they came from the 1980s).

## 🎯 Learning Goals
* Distinguish between different types of data (qualitative vs quantitative, scales of measurement).
* Compute and interpret summary statistics (mean, median, variance, IQR, etc.).
* Build basic plots with Matplotlib (line, bar, scatter, histograms).
* Use Seaborn for more advanced, stylish visualizations.
* Identify trends and outliers in data using visual tools.
