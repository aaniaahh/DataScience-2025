# Data Science - Fall '25

A data science class focuses on using mathematical, statistical, and computational methods to extract meaningful insights from large datasets, enabling data-driven decision-making and prediction. We will learn programming, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization to find hidden patterns and trends that solve real-world problems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Goals
This course integrates hands-on coding with conceptual understanding and light math intuition, ideal for young programmers or non-CS majors. It is also 
* beginner-friendly,
* steadily paced,
* project-focused.
