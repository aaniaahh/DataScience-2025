# DataScience-2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Goals
This course integrates hands-on coding with conceptual understanding and light math intuition, ideal for young programmers or non-CS majors. It is also 
* beginner-friendly,
* steadily paced,
* project-focused.

## ðŸ“š Notebooks
The notebooks will be created in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), then copied and placed in the [Completed](https://github.com/aaniaahh/DataScience-2025/tree/main/Completed) folder
on my [GitHub](https://github.com/aaniaahh/DataScience-2025/tree/main) page.

## ðŸ§  Course Notes
* 3 Mini-Projects:
   * Week 5: First data analysis
   * Week 8: Visual narrative
   * Week 11: Classifier on student-chosen dataset

* Final Project Ideas:
   * Sports predictions
   * Spotify data trends
   * COVID or flu pattern analysis
   * Campus-related mini-research (cafeteria hours vs. attendance?)
   
* Light Math Approach: Focus on intuition over derivation, especially in modeling weeks.
